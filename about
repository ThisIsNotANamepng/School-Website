    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="aboutP">
      <p> This tool is a result of hundereds of hours of work by two students of OHS.  One had an idea after not being able to find a room, despite being a junior. After having COVID and virtual school, we knew incoming freshman wouldn't get to know the school as well as students in years past, so we set out to create an interactive map to help them find their way.</p>
      
      <p>
        It took months, but on xxxxxx it was finally published to be used by the public
